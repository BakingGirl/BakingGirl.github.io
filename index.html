										<h3>Homemade Chocolate Pudding </h3>
										<p>INGREDIENTS
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups whole milk
4 ounces 72% cacao chocolate, melted in a double boiler or microwave
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

DIRECTIONS
1.
In a small saucepan whisk together cornstarch, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt until combined. Whisk in milk until thoroughly combined.

2.
Bring mixture to a light boil over medium heat while whisking constantly. Once pudding has thickened to desired consistency (usually a couple more minutes) remove from heat and pour immediately into a medium bowl. Quickly whisk in chocolate and vanilla. Serve warm, if desired, or place a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap on top of the pudding to prevent pudding skin from forming and refrigerate until you're ready to serve. Pudding will thicken further upon chilling.</p>

										<h3>Lava Cake</h3>
										<p>butter is needed , 2 egg yolks ,2 eggs 3 tablespoons white sugar ,3 1/2 ounces chopped dark chocolate ,5 tablespoons butter ,4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder ,3 tablespoons flour ,1 pinch salt ,1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract and add all ingredients to the list .
Directions

Generously butter the inside of 4 (5 1/2 ounce) ramekins. Place them in a casserole dish.
Whisk together egg yolks, eggs, and sugar in a bowl until light, foamy, and lemon colored.
Melt chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Stir melted chocolate mixture into egg and sugar mixture until combined.
Sift cocoa powder into the mixture; stir to combine.
Sift flour and salt into the mixture; stir to combine into a batter.
Stir vanilla extract into the batter.
Transfer batter to a resealable plastic bag. Snip one corner of the bag with scissors to create a tip.
Divide batter evenly between the prepared ramekins; tap gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles.
Refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Arrange the ramekins in a casserole dish. Pour enough hot tap water into the casserole dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
Bake in the preheated over for 15-18 minutes. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.
Loosen the edges from the ramekin with a knife. Invert each cake onto a plate and dust with powdered sugar.

Tip
Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.

									<h2>Sponge Cake</h2>

								<p class="content">Recipe: Soft Sponge Cake 
Makes: 8" square baking pan - eaten on its own OR
6" square tin if you are making a 3 layer sponge cake 

Ingredients:
A
• 60g butter, melted
• 80g cake flour (sift)
• 80ml milk
• 1 egg + 5 egg yolks

B
• 5 egg whites
• 120g sugar (i use 80g)
• pinch of salt

Method:

1. Preheat oven at 170*C for 15 mins. 

2. Beat 1 egg + 5 yolks until creamy & fluffy on high speed for a few minutes (i go 3mins) or until it double its original volume. Add in flour & alternate it with milk. Add in melted butter and mix well. Set aside.<br><br>

3. Beat egg whites on high speed until white & frothy for about 40sec - 1min. Add in salt & sugar a bit at a time. Beat for about 2 mins until its stiff & thick formy. Once mixture clings & does not drip, it is ready.<br>

4. Fold 1/3 whites with egg yolk batter with a spatula till well combined. Take another 1/3 egg whites, repeat the same step. And same for the last 1/3 egg white. DO NOT OVER MIX<br>! 

5. Pour batter into fully lined baking pan. Give the pan a few good shakes to remove air.<br>

6. Bake a preheated oven 170C for 10mins, then reduce heat to 150C for another 30-35min or till done.<br>

7. Remove from oven and 
Normal baking tin - overturn for 5mins (to prevent cake from sinking) before unmould (to prevent cake from sinking).
Removable tin - Cool for 5min-10min, run a metal spatula or a small sharp knife around inside of pan to lossen cake and unmould.<br>

8. Place them on a wire rack to cool completely (for at least half an hour), remove baking paper if any and spread the sponge with jam/cream/frosting as you desire.<br> 



Tips: 

- Make sure that the mixer attachment and bowl are washed extremely clean at this point. If not, any fat that remains on these utensils will negatively affect the whipping of the egg whites. Keep the items spotless.


- Do not add the egg whites until you are ready to begin cooking your project. Sometimes batters may require refrigeration prior to the actual cooking, but folded egg whites tend to "settle" rather quickly, losing the benefit of having added them to begin with.

- Always fold the lighter ingredient (egg white) into the heavier ingredient (batter).

- Eggs at room temperature whip better than eggs straight out of the fridge.<br>
